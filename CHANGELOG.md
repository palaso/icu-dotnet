## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add Wrapper.Init() method to allow initialization of ICU for
  multi-threaded applications (#54)
- Implement `BreakIterator.Clone()` method (#56) to allow break iterator to be
  used in multi-threaded applications

### Changed

- Create netstandard package (#37/#59, conniey). This allows to use the package with .NET Core
  as well as any other .NET version compatible with .NET Standard 1.6. Additionally we still
  include the binaries for .NET 4.0 and .NET 4.5.1.

### Fixed

- Fix signature of u_charType (#54)
- Don't depend on libc6-dev package (#62)

## [2.2.0] - 2017-09-29

### Fixed

- fix buffer overflow in Normalize() (#47)

### Changed

- Assembly marked as CLSCompliant (#33)
- additionally look in lib/x86 and lib/x64 as well as lib/win-*
  and lib/linux-* for ICU binaries (#51)
- Add minimal support of regular expressions (#32, MURATA Makoto)

## [2.1.0] - 2017-03-17

### Fixed

- implement `IDisposable` in collators

### Changed

- Implement `RuleBasedBreakIterator` class (Connie Yau)
- Make `BreakIterator` closer to `Icu::BreakIterator` (Connie Yau)
- Enable and fix XML documentation (MURATA Makoto, Connie Yau)
- support 64-bit ICU4C (#14 and #30). The unmanaged binaries can either be
  directly in the output directory next to `icu.net.dll`, or in a `x64`
  subdirectory (the 32-bit binaries in a `x86` subdirectory).

## [2.0.1] - 2016-12-19

### Fixed

- Prefer local directory when loading unmanaged ICU binaries. This addresses
  [#20](https://github.com/sillsdev/icu-dotnet/issues/20).
- Fix `CollationStrength.Identical` value to match value used by unmanaged
  binaries.
- Fix casing of a few native methods.

### Changed

- Call native cleanup from Wrapper.Cleanup
- Reset ICU version and method pointers on cleanup.

### Removed

- Removed obsolete debian packaging files

## [2.0.0] - 2016-12-08

### Changed

- Dynamically load ICU binaries, thus allowing to work with any ICU version
- Cross-platform nuget package that is known to work on Windows and Linux
- ICU binaries moved to separate nuget packages (`Icu4C.Win.*`)
- Change versioning scheme. Previously the versions for the nuget package included
  the ICU version. Now we follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
